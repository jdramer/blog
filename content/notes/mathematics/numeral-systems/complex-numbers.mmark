## Imaginary numbers

- Invented to solve problems where an equation has no real roots e.g. $$x^2 + 16 = 0$$, the idea of declaring the existence of a quantity $$i$$ such that $$i^2 = -1$$ allows us to express the solution as

$$
x = \sqrt{-16} = \sqrt{16i^2} = \pm4i
$$

The set represented by $$\mathbb{I}$$ defines an imaginary number as

$$
i^2 = -1
$$

### Powers of i

If $$i^2 = -1$$ then $$i^4 = i^2i^2 = -1 * -1 = 1$$

Therefore we have the sequence

$$
\begin{array}{ccccc}
\hline
i & i^2 & i^3 & i^4 & i^5 & \ldots \\
\hline
i & -1 & -i & 1 & i & \ldots \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

## Complex numbers

A complex number is just the sum of a real and an imaginary number

$$
z = a + bi  \quad a,b \in \mathbb{R}, \quad i^2 = -1
$$

### Operations on complex numbers

Given two complex numbers

$$
z_1 = a_1 + b_1i \\
z_2 = a_2 + b_2i
$$

#### Addition and subtraction

$$
z_1 \pm z_2 = a_1 \pm a_2 + (b_1 \pm b_2)i
$$

#### Product

$$
\begin{align*}
z_1z_2 &= a_1a_2 + a_1b_2i + a_2b_1i + b_1b_2i^2 \quad \text{given that $i^2 = -1$} \\
&= (a_1a_2 - b_1b_2) + (a_1b_2 + b_1a_2)i
\end{align*}
$$

Given the complex number

$$
z = a + bi
$$

#### Norm (modulus or absolute value)

$$
|z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
$$

#### Complex conjugate

The product of two complex numbers where the only difference between them is the **sign** of the imaginary part is

$$
(a + bi)(a - bi) = a^2 - abi + abi - b^2i^2 = a^2 + b^2
$$

This quantity $$a - bi$$ is called the *complex conjugate* of $$z$$ (denoted as $$z^*$$), it implies that

$$
zz^* = |z|^2
$$

#### Inverse

$$
z^{-1} = \frac{1}{z}
$$

Multiplying the numerator and denominator with the conjugate of $$z$$ (so that we have a real part on the denominator)

$$
z^{-1} = \frac{1}{z} \frac{z^*}{z^*} = \frac{z^*}{zz^*} = \frac{z^*}{|z|^2}
$$

#### Square root of $$i$$

We're trying to find a complex number $$z$$ such that

$$
\sqrt{i} = z \\
i = z^2
$$

Assuming that $$z$$ is the complex number $$z = a + bi$$

$$
\begin{align}
i &= (a + bi)^2 \nonumber \\
&= (a + bi)(a + bi) \nonumber \\
&= a^2 - b^2 + 2abi \label{square-imaginary}
\end{align}
$$

Therefore

$$
(a^2 - b^2) + (2ab)i = 0 + 1i
$$

Equaling real and imaginary parts

$$
\begin{align*}
a^2 - b^2 &= 0 \\
2ab = 1
\end{align*}
$$

Therefore $$a = \pm b$$, replacing $$a = -b$$ in the second equation we obtain $$-2b^2 = 1$$ which is not satisfied by any real number $$b$$ therefore the case $$a = -b$$ is impossible, replacing $$a = b$$ in the second equation we obtain $$2a^2 = 1$$ so

$$
2a^2 = 1 \\
a^2 = \frac{1}{2} \\
a = b = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
$$

Finally the value of $$\sqrt{i}$$ is

$$
\sqrt{i} = (a + bi) = \pm{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}} (1 + i)
$$

The value of $$\sqrt{-i}$$ is found in the same way (by replacing $$b = -a$$ in the equation $$-2ab = 1$$ found from multiplying \eqref{square-imaginary} by $$-1$$)

$$
\sqrt{-i} = (a + bi) = \pm{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}} (1 - i)
$$

### Matrix representation of a complex number

The matrix $$C$$ for a complex number is the sum of two other matrices representing the real $$R$$ and imaginary $$I$$ parts:

$$
C = R + I
$$

which can be written as

$$
C = a \hat{R} + b \hat{I} \quad\quad a, b \in \mathbb{R}
$$

Where $$R = 1$$ and $$I = i$$

The matrix representation of $$R = 1$$ in 2d is the identity matrix

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

To find the matrix representation of $$i$$ we have to analyze the definition of $$i$$ which is *a quantity* which squares to $$-1$$, given that we already know the value of $$1$$ in matrix form

$$
\begin{align*}
i^2 &= -1 * \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix} \\
&= \begin{bmatrix}
-1 & 0 \\
0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$

Squaring the following matrix gives the matrix above, then the value of $$i$$ expressed in matrix form is

$$
I = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & -1 \\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Finally the value of $$C$$ is

$$
C = a \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix} + b \begin{bmatrix}
0 & -1 \\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
a & -b \\
b & a
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### The complex plane

The powers of $$i$$ give rise to the sequence $$(1, i, -1, -i, 1, \ldots)$$ which is quite similar to the pattern
$$(x, y, -x, -y, x, \ldots)$$, the resemblance is no coincidence as complex number belong to a 2-dimensional plane, this complex plane allows us to visualize complex numbers using the horizontal axis for the real part and the vertical axis for the imaginary part

<div id="complex-plane"></div>
<div class="center">$$1, i, -1, -i$$</div>

We can see that the positions of $$i^0 = 1, i^1 = i, i^2 = -1, i^3 = -i, \ldots$$ suggest that the multiplication of a complex number by $$i$$ is equivalent to rotating through 90 degrees

e.g.

$$
\begin{align*}
z_1 &= 2 + i \\
z_2 &= (2 + i)(i) = -1 + 2i \\
z_3 &= (-1 + 2i)(i) = -2 - i \\
z_4 &= (-2 - i)(i) = 1 - 2i \\
z_5 &= (1 - 2i)(i) = 2 + i = z_1
\end{align*}
$$

<div id="complex-2-i"></div>

> A complex number is rotated $$\pm 90^{\circ}$$ by multiplying it by $$\pm i$$

Let's graph the roots of $$\sqrt{i} = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (1 + i)$$

<div id="complex-square-root"></div>

We can see that $$\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (1 + i)$$ is exactly at $$45^{\circ}$$ and $$- \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (1 + i)$$ is exactly at $$225^{\circ}$$

Let's multiply the complex number $$2 + i$$ by $$\sqrt{i}$$ (it should rotate it by $$45^{\circ}$$)

$$
\begin{align*}
z_1 &= 2 + i \\
z_2 &= (2 + i)(\sqrti + \sqrti i) = \sqrti + 3 \sqrti i
\end{align*}
$$

<div id="complex-45"></div>

Multiplying $$z_2$$ by $$\sqrt{i}$$ again should be equal to multiplying $$z_1$$ by $$i$$ (because $$z_2$$ is already rotated by $$45^{\circ}$$)

$$
\begin{align*}
z_2 &= \sqrti + 3 \sqrti i \\
z_3 &= (\sqrti + 3 \sqrti i)(\sqrti + \sqrti i) \\
&= (\frac{1}{2} - \frac{3}{2}) + (\frac{1}{2} + \frac{3}{2})i \\
&= -1 + 2i
\end{align*}
$$

Which is exactly what we find if we multiply $$z_i$$ by $$i$$, these observations suggest that we can build a complex number which can rotate another complex number by any angle

> A complex number is rotated $$45^{\circ}$$ by multiplying it by $$\sqrti + \sqrti i$$

> A complex number is rotated $$225^{\circ}$$ by multiplying it by $$-\sqrti + \sqrti i$$

### Polar representation

Instead of using coordinates in the complex plane we can represent a polar number with the length of the vector from the origin to the complex coordinate and the angle between the complex vector and the positive real axis

$$
r = |z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\
\theta = arctan(\frac{b}{a})
$$

The horizontal component of $$z$$ is then $$r * cos(\theta)$$ and the vectical component is $$r * sin(\theta)$$, expressing the complex number using these quantities

$$
\begin{align*}
z &= a + bi \\
&= r * \cos \theta + ri\; \sin \theta \\
&= r \; (\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)
\end{align*}
$$

Euler provided the identity

$$
\begin{equation}\label{rotor}
e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta
\end{equation}
$$

Which allows us to represent any complex number as

$$
z = r\,e^{i\theta}
$$

Given two polar numbers

$$
z = r\,e^{i\theta} \\
w = s\,e^{i\phi} \\
$$

Their product is

$$
zw = rs\, e^{i(\theta + \phi)} = rs [ \cos (\theta + \phi) + i \sin (\theta + \phi)]
$$

Which effectively rotated the complex number $$z$$ by $$\phi$$ angles! However the quantity $$zw$$ was scaled $$s$$ units, to avoid scalling we can normalize $$w$$ (i.e. making $$r = 1$$ which is equal to \eqref{rotor})

> A *rotor* is a complex number that rotates another complex number by an angle $$\theta$$ (through multiplication) and has the form
>
$$
e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta
$$

Rotating a complex number $$x + yi$$ by an angle $$\theta$$

$$
\begin{align*}
x' + y'i &= (x + yi)(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) \\
&= (x \cos \theta - y \sin \theta) + (x \sin \theta + y \cos \theta)i
\end{align*}
$$

Which in matrix form is

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
x' & -y' \\
y' & x'
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
x & -y \\
y & x
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
\cos \theta & -\sin \theta \\
\sin \theta & \cos \theta
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Note that because of the way the complex product is defined, the multiplication between two complex numbers commutes

$$
\begin{align*}
x' + y'i &= (\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)(x + yi)\\
&= (x \cos \theta - y \sin \theta) + (x \sin \theta + y \cos \theta)i
\end{align*}
$$
