> Let $$a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$$, we say that $$a$$ _**divides**_ $$b$$, written $$a \divides b$$, if there's an integer $$n$$ so that
>
$$
b = na
$$

If $$a$$ divides $$b$$ then $$b$$ is _**divisible**_ by $$a$$ and $$a$$ is a _**divisor or factor**_ of $$b$$, also $$b$$ is called a _**multiple**_ of $$a$$.

Additional properties of the relation $$\divides$$:

1. if $$a \divides b$$ and $$b \divides c$$ then $$a \divides c$$
2. if $$a \divides b$$ and $$c \divides d$$ then $$ac \divides bd$$
3. if $$d \divides a$$ and $$d \divides b$$ then $$d \divides a + b$$
4. if $$d \divides a$$ and $$d \divides b$$ then $$d \divides ax + by$$ for any
   integers $$x,y$$

Proof.

1. if $$b=ma$$ and $$c=nb$$ then $$c=(nm)a$$
2. if $$b=ma$$ and $$d=nc$$ then $$bd=(nm)ac$$
3. if $$a=md$$ and $$b=nd$$ then $$a + b=(m + n)d$$
4. if $$a=md$$, $$b=nd$$ then $$ax=(mx)d$$, $$by=(ny)d$$ therefore $$ax + by = (mx + ny)d$$

## Division algorithm

> Let $$a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$$ with $$b > 0$$, then there exists $$q, r \in \mathbb{Z}$$ such that
>
$$
a = bq + r, \quad \text{where $0 \leq r \lt b$}
$$

Proof. if $$bq$$ is the largest multiple of $$b$$ that does not exceed $$a$$ then $$r = a - bq$$ is positive and since $$b(q + 1) > a$$ then $$r \lt b$$.

Also, if $$r = 0$$ then $$a = bq$$ which implies that $$q \divides a$$.

## Greatest common divisor

Let $$a, b \in \mathbb{N}$$, the greatest common divisor of $$a$$ and $$b$$, written as $$gcd(a,b)$$ or $$(a,b)$$, is the element $$d$$ in $$\mathbb{N}$$ such that $$d \divides a$$ and $$d \divides b$$ and every common divisor of $$a$$ and $$b$$ also divides $$d$$.

> Let $$a$$ and $$b$$ be two numbers in $$\mathbb{N}$$, the value of $$(a,b)$$ is a *linear combination* of $$a$$ and $$b$$ i.e. there exists $$s,t$$ in $$\mathbb{Z}$$ such that
>
$$
sa + tb = (a, b)
$$

Proof.

Let $$d$$ be the least positive integer that is a *linear combination* of $$a$$ and $$b$$

$$
d = sa + tb
$$

First lets show that $$d \divides a$$, by the division algorithm we know that

$$
a = dq + r, \quad \text{where $0 \le r \lt d$}
$$

It follows that

$$
\begin{align*}
r &= a - dq \\
&= a - (sa + tb)q \\
&= a - saq - tbq \\
&= (1 - sq)a + (-tq)b \\
\end{align*}
$$

We can see that $$r$$ is a linear combination of $$a$$ and $$b$$. Since $$0 \le r \lt d$$ and considering that we defined $$d$$ as the *least positive* linear combination of $$a$$ and $$b$$ it follows that $$r = 0$$ (if $$0 \lt r \lt d$$ then $$r$$ would be the least possible linear combination which is a contradiction), therefore $$d \divides a$$.

In a similar fashion $$d \divides b$$, therefore by the divisibility property #4

$$
d \divides sa + tb
$$

The next thing to prove is that $$d$$ is the *greatest common divisor* of $$a$$ and
$$b$$. To prove this lets show that if $$d'$$ is any other common divisor of $$a$$ and
$$b$$ then $$d' \le d$$.

If $$d' \divides a$$ and $$d' \divides b$$ then by the divisibility property #4 it divides any other linear combination of $$a$$ and $$b$$, since $$d = sa + bt$$ is one linear combination of $$a$$ and $$b$$ it follows that $$d' \divides d$$ so either $$d' \lt d$$ or $$d' = d$$, finally we can conclude that

$$
d = (a,b)
$$

### Euclidean Algorithm

A very efficient method to compute the *greatest common denominator*

> Suppose $$a, b$$ be integers with $$a \ge b \gt 0$$
>
> 1. Apply the division algorithm $$a = bq + r, 0 \le r \lt b$$
> 2. Rename $$b$$ as $$a$$ and $$r$$ as $$b$$ and repeat 1 until $$r = 0$$
> The last nonzero remainder is the *greatest common divisor* of $$a$$ and $$b$$

The euclidean algorithm depends on the following lemma

> Let $$a, b$$ be integers with $$a \ge b \gt 0$$. Let $$r$$ be the remainder of dividing $$a$$ by $$b$$ then
>
$$
(a,b) = (b, r)
$$

*Proof.* Let $$q$$ be the quotient of dividing $$a$$ by $$b$$ so that $$a = bq + r$$. If $$d = (a,b)$$ then it must divide any other *linear combination* of $$a$$ and $$b$$ like $$r = a - bq$$, therefore $$d \divides r$$. Finally we can conclude that $$d = (b,r)$$.

*Proof of the theorem* If we keep on repeating the division algorithm we have:

$$
\begin{align*}
a &= bq_1 + r_1,  \quad (a,b) = (b, r_1) \\
b &= r_1q_2 + r_2,  \quad (b, r_1) = (r_1, r_2) \\
r_1 &= r_2q_3 + r_3,  \quad (r_1, r_2) = (r_2, r_3) \\
r_2 &= r_3q_4 + r_4,  \quad (r_2, r_3) = (r_3, r_4) \\
& \; \vdots \\
r_{n-3} &= r_{n-2}q_{n-1} + r_{n-1}, \quad (r_{n-3}, r_{n-2}) = (r_{n-2}, r_{n-1}) \\
r_{n-2} &= r_{n-1}q_n + r_n, \quad (r_{n-2}, r_{n-1}) = (r_{n-1}, r_n) \\
r_{n-1} &= r_n q_{n+1}, \quad \quad (r_{n-1}, r_n) = r_n
\end{align*}
$$

Therefore

$$
(a,b) = (b,r_1) = (r_1,r_2) = (r_2, r_3) = (r_3, r_4) = \ldots = (r_{n-3}, r_{n-2}) = (r_{n-2}, r_{n-1}) = (r_{n-1}, r_n) = r_n
$$

### Extended Euclidean Algorithm

<!--
Let's rewrite $$r_n$$ in terms of the previous $$r_i$$

$$
r_n = r_{n-2} - r_{n-1} q_n
$$

Substituting for $$r_{n-1}$$ from the previous equation

$$
\begin{align**}
r_n &= r_{n-2} - (r_{n-3} - r_{n-2} q_{n-1}) q_n \\
r_n &= r_{n-2} (1 + q_n q_{n-1}) - r_{n-3} q_n \\
r_n &= r_{n-3} (-q_n) + r_{n-2} (1 + q_n q_{n-1})
\end{align**}
$$

Substituting for $$r_{n-2}$$

$$
\begin{align**}
r_n &= r_{n-3} (-q_n) + (r_{n-4} - r_{n-3} q_{n-2}) (1 + q_n q_{n-1}) \\
r_n &= r_{n-3} (-q_n) + r_{n-4} - r_{n-3} q_{n-2} + r_{n-4} q_n q_{n-1} - r_{n-3} q_{n-2} q_n q_{n-1} \\
r_n &= r_{n-4} (1 + q_n q_{n-1}) + r_{n-3} (-q_n - q_{n-2} - q_{n} q_{n-1} q_{n-2}) \\
\end{align**}
$$

We could keep on doing substitutions with the previous equations like we did above until the quantities $$r_i$$ and $$r_{i-1}$$ become $$a$$ and $$b$$ respectively.
-->

One of the applications of the *euclidean algorithm* is the calculation of the integers $$x,y$$ satisfying $$d = (a,b) = ax + by$$

First note that if $$b=0$$ then $$(a,b) = (a,0) = a$$, now assume that there are integers $$x'$$ and $$y'$$ so that

$$
(a,b) = (b,r) = bx' + ry'
$$

Since

$$
\begin{align*}
r &= a - bq \\
&= a - b \left \lfloor \frac{a}{b} \right \rfloor
\end{align*}
$$

Then

$$
\begin{align*}
(a,b) &= bx' + \Big( a - \left \lfloor \frac{a}{b} \right \rfloor b \Big) y' \\
&= bx' + ay' - \left \lfloor \frac{a}{b} \right \rfloor by' \\
&= a(y') + b \Big(x' - \left \lfloor \frac{a}{b} \right \rfloor y'\Big)
\end{align*}
$$

Comparing it to $$(a,b) = ax + by$$ we obtain the required coefficients $$x$$ and $$y$$ based on the following recursive equations

$$
\begin{align*}
x &=
\begin{cases}
1, & \text{when $r = 0$} \\
y', & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} \\
y &=
\begin{cases}
0, & \text{when $r = 0$} \\
x' - \left \lfloor \frac{a}{b} \right \rfloor y', & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
$$
