00:00:12,327 --> 00:00:16,043
To dance

00:00:29,139 --> 00:00:32,659
All my life I've searched for you

00:00:32,919 --> 00:00:37,096
You're my dream of a woman, my dream of a woman

Hola bonita! I like your look

No designers, but everyone here watches

20
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:31,179
The lips are red, they match the dress

21
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:33,149
Love your curves, bachata the vibe

22
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:35,459
Baby, te quiero, 'cause you're not looking for Dinero

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,570
Other women interest me zero

00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,460
Can't handle your body

00:01:42,933 --> 00:01:44,923
The bartender brings us Moloko with ice cream

28
00:01:44,973 --> 00:01:46,853
Just you and me, we forget the time

29
00:01:46,933 --> 00:01:49,303
When you shake your hips, everyone knows, yeah

30
00:01:49,363 --> 00:01:51,383
Every movement is suavemente

31
00:01:51,473 --> 00:01:53,336
Rhythm in the blood, caliente

32
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:55,426
Hope the evening ends with you
