## Computational process

**Represents an abstract entity that runs some work inside a computer**, it may manage *data* according to a pattern of rules called a *program*.

## Elements of programming

Every program written in some programming language deals with the following entities:

- **data** - stuff that we want to manipulate
- **procedures** - description of the rules to manipulate data

A programming language serves as a framework used to organize ideas about processes, ideally a language should provide a way to *combine simple ideas to form more complex ideas*.

Every powerful language provides the following:

- **primitive expressions**, the simplest entities the language is concerned with
- **means of combination**, by which compound elements are built from simpler ones
- **means of abstraction**, by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units

We can combine a primitive expression with a *primitive procedure* such as `*` or `+` to form a **compound expression**

We can give a name to a compound expression and treat it as a unit, this is then referred as a **compound procedure**, this procedure can be used in combination with other expressions in the form of an operator or a simple value.
