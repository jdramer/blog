## Before you start

Congrats! **Preparing** for an interview is a rewarding and fun journey, note that I said **preparing** for an interview instead of
acing it because passing an interview could be the outcome of enough and good preparation (luck is involved too but I'll get to this shortly), the process is rewarding because
you improve your ability to come up with a solution to an algorithmic problem in a short amount of time, also, the concepts that you learn when you're preparing for the 
system design interviews are invaluable and will be helpful throughout your career.

My plan was to interview with my target top companies (Airbnb, Facebook, Google) at once and I wanted to do the onsites close to each other (with at
least one day to rest between interviews), I got awesome recruiters that helped me schedule the 3 onsites in 2 weeks. This plan contains notes that are applicable 
to any company as well as specifics for each of my target companies.

Understand that **luck is involved in the interview process**, you may have prepared a lot but:

- you might get stage fright during the interview, you can decrease the anxiety effect with enough practice but I guess that this feeling will always be there
- you might be unable to make progress because the problem is too hard to solve because you didn't practice that topic enough or you just missed that small insight
- there might be an external factor that you can't control, for example you might not click with your interviewer, your interviewer might be having a bad day or 
during the HC review there's someone that dislikes something about the interview round notes even though all the interviewers gave you a positive score. 

You increase your chances of landing a job at a top company if you interview with more of them, this seems obvious but it
took me some courage to attempt more times because I was afraid of the rejection, 
it helped to switch my mentality to focus more on the preparation instead of the result.

For stage fright just practice a lot either at pramp or with a friend that's experienced in interviews (highly recommended), 
the more you practice the better you'll become at communicating your solution as well as controlling the time, 
when I started I could come up with a solution for a coding problem but I'd present it in a disordered way, I'd explain the solution and start coding it right
away without realizing that I was solving the wrong problem or I'd talk too much without considering the time and I'd eat valuable time in the interview that I could
use for the follow up question or for tests, when I practiced system design interviews I'd jump across the system design
stages or I'd go way too deep into the detailed design when I was talking about the high level design. After I did enough mock
interview rounds with my friend I was able to correct these problems as well as come up with an ordered way to tackle each coding problem.

For hard problems always try to come up with examples, I got followup questions where I didn't have an idea of where to start
so after cycling through some data structures I decided to write some examples, then I could find a pattern and finally
the data structures and algorithms that would help me solve the problem. If you can't make progress ask for help! If you get
a good interviewer he/she might realize you need help but in any case keep this step as a last resort when you're completely stuck.

For external factors there's nothing you can do, just focus your energy on the next interview instead of thinking what you could've done better.

Finally my journey wasn't without failures, I failed multiple interviews with top companies, I was naive in the past and when I decided to 
interview I'd "put all of my eggs in one basket" (meaning interviewing only with one company at a time in years) and fail but 
now I realize that the interview process gave me invaluable information that helped me in my next attempts, 
if you fail, it just means that you've failed that attempt, after all of your rounds reflect what you did good and bad and focus on improving 
that part for the next attempt.

<p class="has-text-right"><i>Seneca</i></p>
</div>
</div>

Getting an offer is not the end of the journey, it might be possible that even after you reach your target company and you
work there for some years you might look for new challenges in other top companies, the interview skill is something
that you should keep up to date. Good luck! 

## Summary

*(If you haven't interviewed in the past and wanna get noticed)*

- If you're a student, enjoy the student life! (I miss those awesome days) work on something that's challenging and interesting
that makes you stand out from the rest, in my case I used to be a competitive programmer and was also really into creating my own
projects for fun, [I actually managed to have a JS library featured in a magazine once!](https://javascriptweekly.com/issues/194), 
([link to the project](https://mauriciopoppe.github.io/PojoViz/public/vulcanize.html#readme)) 
- [Participate in Coding Contests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueNT-w7Oluw), I solved thousands of problems over the years,
 all of my solutions are in [this repo](https://github.com/mauriciopoppe/competitive-programming)
- Google has something cool called https://foobar.withgoogle.com/ learn about it [here](https://medium.com/plutonic-services/things-you-should-know-about-google-foobar-invitation-703a535bf30f), you could try to get it
- If you are working full time look for opportunities to work on hard problems to show leadership, **take the opportunity, no pain no gain**
- Make sure your resume shines and aim for a 1 page resume, [here's the CV I used for this round (with my personal details removed)](https://www.overleaf.com/read/fvdmbqtskgsw)

Before I wanted to interview

- Do the daily Leetcode challenge, it's an awesome way to keep the interview coding skill up to date
- Participate in Leetcode contests every Saturday, or Codeforces when it's available 
- Read/code/have experience in scalable systems, collect/read interesting papers and read the red book [Designing Data Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/),
I focused a lot on this part since the last time I failed my last onsite was because of system design.
- Get to know myself and the places I'd like to work, check if my values match the company core values

{{< interview who="airbnb" >}}
I've been a fan of their engineering
blog ever since I saw this article [Rearchitecting Airbnbâ€™s Frontend](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/rearchitecting-airbnbs-frontend-5e213efc24d2), 
moreover I had the opportunity to use part of their work presented in [Dynein: Building an Open-source Distributed Delayed Job Queueing System](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/dynein-building-a-distributed-delayed-job-queueing-system-93ab10f05f99) at work,
in addition, the obsession for what "belong anywhere" means matches my core values, if you don't know what it means I highly 
recommend this [Ted talk by Joe Gebbia, one of the co-founders of Airbnb](https://www.ted.com/talks/joe_gebbia_how_airbnb_designs_for_trust?language=en) and 
if you know spanish listen to this [story by a writer that had a heart attack while staying at an Airbnb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVuMmcFu9uI)
{{< /interview >}}

{{< interview who="facebook" >}}
In the Facebook HQ you see their core values everywhere, one phrase that stuck with me in one of their buildings is *what would you do if you weren't afraid?*.
A few of my friends work there for a long time already and it's been one of my target companies for a while, [their engineering blog](https://engineering.fb.com/) is filled with 
so many gems across multiple fields, as a Frontend developer I learned a lot from [Browserlab](https://engineering.fb.com/web/browserlab-automated-regression-detection-for-the-web/) whose
infrastructure design I used as inspiration in a project I did at work with [WebPagetest](https://www.webpagetest.org/). 
{{< /interview >}}

{{< interview who="google" >}}
I use a lot of Google products every day and I really love their high quality, they're always setting standards in engineering in the industry as well
as making sure that their research is available to the world, a lot of companies including mine have benefited from all the open source projects that they
produce/support, [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is the core component in the infra of many companies and it looks like a magic box to the engineers that use it.
{{< /interview >}}

NOTE about picking your companies: I only interviewed with the companies that I wanted to work for, another strategy is to apply to all the top
companies hoping to get multiple offers and then choosing one that's fair.

When I was ready to interview

- Contact the recruiters, schedule phone screens in 3 to 4 weeks, more time to prepare for the phone screen is an overkill
because I'll burn out even before practicing the system design questions.
- Practice only coding for the phone screens, the plan is detailed below.
- After the phone screen interviews, schedule onsites in 4 to 6 weeks (I did 4 weeks), I also made sure that the onsites
were as close as possible to a target date with enough breathing room to rest.
- Practice mainly system design and coding to a less extent, give yourself enough breathing room to not burn out.
- Practice behavioral type of questions, each company has its own way to assess this part that's described below.
- Go through the onsites, get to a mental state where you're ready for the next interview regardless of the outcome of the previous one.
- Receive feedback from the recruiters and the HC, go through the team matching interviews if you passed the HC, remember that **you don't have an offer yet**.
- If you get offers, learn to negotiate, read [Salary negotiation strategies everyone in tech already knows â€” but you donâ€™t](https://candor.co/guides/salary-negotiation) and/or
get professional help.
- If you don't get an offer, learn from your mistakes and move on, you'll have enough time to reflect and think about the plan for the next attempt.

## Coding

### Phone screen preparation

- My phone screen preparation took 3 to 4 weeks, warmup for the 1st week: solve a few easy/medium problems in Leetcode, remember the STL ([if your programming language is C++ I have a refresher article](/notes/computer-science/programming-languages/cpp-refresher/)).
- Focus on breadth, a nice schedule based on your timeline can be found in the EPI book, then pick problems from your weakest area.
- Practice EPI questions, I've already read EPI multiple times so I just had to review their intro for STL methods for every chapter and glance
through the questions and the solutions if I need to, to practice and test if your implementation works use the [EPI Judge](https://github.com/adnanaziz/EPIJudge).
- Start solving medium type of questions and target hard questions, review medium questions that you may have solved in the past, also review how other people solved it (you'll learn
something new every time).
- Go through this list of lists of patterns [Important and Useful links from all over Leetcode](https://Leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/665604/important-and-useful-links-from-all-over-the-Leetcode),
it's by far the best source of knowledge and problems to solve for your preparation.
- Participate in the weekly Leetcode contest every Saturday at 7:30PM PT.
- Buy Leetcode premium and do a lot of mock interviews (at least 2 per day), force yourself to be in the session and don't exit prematurely, 
get into the habit of drawing examples in comments (when I interviewed there were only virtual onsites).

Here's an example of what I'd do in my head and in code, say what you're thinking out loud, your thought process might
make you come up with an strategy or might help the interviewer guide you if you're stuck

{{< interview-example >}}

Example Problem: [1105. Filling Bookcase Shelves](https://leetcode.com/problems/filling-bookcase-shelves/)

We're given an array of books represented as `[width, height]` and a parameter `shelf_width`, 
what we want to do is accumulate consecutive books in the shelves of a bookshelf, the sum of the widths of the books must not be greater 
than the input `shelf_width`, the height of a single shelf is the max height across all the books on the shelf, what we're looking for is to minimize
the total height of the bookshelf which is the sum of all the max heights across all of the shelves.

```
Input: books = [[1,1],[2,3],[2,3],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,2]], shelf_width = 4
Output: 6
```

I'm trying to understand why the output is 6, I think I'd get 6 if I do:

```
[
   [1,1],                         sum(width) = 1, max height = 1
   [2,3], [2,3]                   sum(width) = 4, max height = 3
   [1,1], [1,1], [1,1], [1,2]     sum(width) = 4, max height = 2
]
sum(max height) = 6
```

**Question**: is it possible to have a book whose width is greater than `shelf_width`?

**Answer**: not possible

**Question**: it looks like I could have several solutions whose output is the optimal value, I guess we're only interested
in the sum of the max heights and not in the location of each book right?

**Answer**: yes, not interested in the location of the books, just in the height of the bookshelf

**Question**: is it possible for the sum to overflow `int`?

**Answer**: no, the answer fits inside an `int`

----

**Possible greedy strategy**: It looks like I can solve it with a greedy strategy, if take items from right to left (i.e. starting at the bottom) 
and I can keep accumulating books until I get enough books for the current shelf whose sum doesn't go beyond `shelf_width` e.g.

```
[
    [1,2], [1,1], [1,1], [1,1]
    [2,3], [2,3],
    [1,1]
]
```

**Possible question that I might get asked**: is this greedy strategy going to work for all the cases? is there an example where it fails?
I'll think about a case that might break the greedy solution, the case that breaks it is:

```
books = [5,5], [5,5], [2,2], shelf_width = 7
```

In the case above I'd take `[2,2], [5,5]` in the last row and `[5,5]` in the first one with a total height of 10, the optimal is 7
so I think that the greedy approach won't work.

**Brainstorm brute force**: For a brute for solution I'd put some books in a shelf and then attempt to put the remaining books
in the next shelf and so on recursively, in the recursion I'd have a parameter `i` that's would tell me where to start in the array
of books, to decide how many books I can put in a shelf I'd also need an accumulator that keeps track of the current width sum

**Optimized brute force width dp**:
I see that the solution above will create cases where we're trying to solve the problem with the same parameters
again, I think we can use DP and the recurrence would be: 

```
T(i) = min(height[k]) from k = i up to k = books.size() + T(k + 1)
T(books.size()) = 0
constraint for T(i): sum(width[k], width[k + 1], ...) <= shelf_width
```

The time complexity would be `O(mn)` where `m` is a variable whose value depends on how many books I can put in a shelf,
I think that in the worst case it could be `n` so overall it's `O(n^2)`.

The space complexity would be `O(n)` since we're storing a solution for every index of the array of books.

**Question for the interviewer** Do you think that this algorithm would work? I don't know what's the max value of `n`?

**Possible answer** Yes, it'll work, `n` is small enough so that an `O(n^2)` algorithm works.

---

Finally you can code it and test it, make sure you review your implementation before testing as you may find variables
that are invalid or small logic errors

<style>
.language-cpp {
    border: none !important;
}
</style>

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minHeightShelves(vector<vector<int>>& books, int shelf_width) {
        const int INF = 1e9;
        vector<int> dp(books.size(), INF);

        function<int(int)> solve = [&](int i) -> int {
            if (i == books.size()) return 0;
            if (dp[i] != INF) return dp[i];
            int max_h = 0;
            int acc_width = 0;
            int j = i;
            while (j < books.size() && books[j][0] + acc_width <= shelf_width) {
                acc_width += books[j][0];
                max_h = max(max_h, books[j][1]);
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], max_h + solve(j + 1));
                ++j;
            }
            return dp[i];
        };
        
        return solve(0);
    }
};

/*

T(0) =
        [1,1] + T(1)
        [1,1], [2,3] + T(2)

T(1) = 
        [2,3] + T(2)
        [2,3], [2,3] + T(3)

T(2) = 
        [2,3] + T(3)
        ... this path would take the incorrect branch
*/

```

Then compute the last `T(x)` (the ones closer to the end of the array) and propagate the values up the stack. 

Come up with additional tests if you have time, probably you can handle edge cases like what if the array is empty too.
If you get a good question the above will not be enough and you might have a followup question where you attempt to solve the problem with less
space or with a better time complexity.

{{< /interview-example >}}

- Also go through the questions sorted by company, depending on the company you might get asked questions from their
pool, don't memorize questions, instead learn the techniques used in each problem.
- Master Big O notation and understand [the time/space complexity of all the data structures that you might use](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/), big focus here on the differences between
a `map`, `unordered_map`, `set`, `unordered_set`, `multiset`, `priority_queue`, `queue`, `stack`, `vector`, etc. Also master Big O for recurrences (you can derive the master
theorem so you don't need to memorize it, [learn how to solve recurrences by doing a guess and proving your guess by induction or by unrolling the recurrence](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs473/sp2010/notes/99-recurrences.pdf)) 
- **Pair with a friend and do 45 minute interviews, take turns to interview each other**, this according to me is the best way 
to prepare because you're actually doing what you're supposed to do in an interview.

### Onsite preparation

- After the phone screen interviews, schedule onsites in 4 to 6 weeks (I did 4 weeks)
- Pick new problems based on how weak I felt in the patterns shown in the [leetcode master link](https://Leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/665604/important-and-useful-links-from-all-over-the-Leetcode), 
I discarded some problems that had a bad thumbs up/thumbs down ratio
- Pick solved problems and review your solutions if you did them recently, if you solved them a long time ago redo them, re-read solutions by other people
- Do mock interviews again and again, I eventually went through all the onsite mock interviews for Google and Facebook
- Participate in the weekly Leetcode contest

Some additional notes for each of my target companies

{{< interview who="airbnb" >}}
- They may ask a single LC Hard Question in the 45m interview, check the ones tagged with Airbnb in Leetcode
- The code that you write MUST compile and run with test cases that you prepare, make sure to know the libraries 
that you need to include in your file to compile your code
{{< /interview >}}

{{< interview who="facebook" >}}
- One of their core values is `move fast` therefore they expect you to come up with a brute force solution and an
optimized solution pretty fast, practice for speed.
- The coding platform is coderpad with their logo watermark
- You can't run your code so make sure you check it once after you're done coding and before testing it and debug it
with some test cases
- They typically ask 2 LC easy to medium type of questions, it might be possible that you run out of time explaining
your approach! As I said practice for speed.
{{< /interview >}}

{{< interview who="google" >}}
- Hardest one to practice because of how unpredictable is, you may get a warmup question that has a follow up that turns it into medium or hard, you
may also get a question with a nice story that's hiding a well known algorithm like sliding window.
- Interviews used to be in google docs but now they have their own coding platform https://interview.google.com (the 
recruiting coordinator will give you unique links for each one).
- You can't run your code so make sure you check it once after you're done coding and before testing it and debug it
with some test cases.
- Back of the envelope calculations might be needed for coding too, make sure you understand the memory layout
of the data structures that you'll use in your programming language.
- For the followups that you won't be able to solve because of the time limit, get into the habit of expressing your ideas
clearly in typed text, I don't know if these notes are used by the interviewer or read by the HC, for example:
  - **Interviewer**: The solution that you proposed should work fine, how would you modify your algorithm so that it runs faster if there are no resource constraints?
  - **You**: I can improve the performance of my algorithm by using multiple threads doing X or I can parallelize the work by using map reduce where the map function is M 
    and the reduce function is R

### About practicing with someone

Practicing with someone and taking turns is the best way to get used to the interview environment, to practice
I used this template with a friend: [Google Docs template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TKNUaBdgzEoPaD8LNexz9JlquRKc1ZSBnNJuZmhFp4Y/edit?usp=sharing)

how problems are solved in EPI more though 

## System Design

System design interviews are very unpredictable, you could practice a lot but the problem that you may get touches
a point that you've never seen before so you have to come up with something based on your experience.

### Acquiring knowledge

- Watch all the videos from the [MIT 6.824 Distributed Systems](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/schedule.html) course and **do the labs**,
this resource helped immensely during the team matching phase at Google where I had a chance to show what I learned
and how I could be useful to the team (I matched the Anthos GKE Storage team), 
my favorite lectures: [all the Raft ones](https://thesquareplanet.com/blog/students-guide-to-raft/) and how Facebook uses Memcached.
- Watch tons of presentations about how big companies solve problems at scale, my links will be below
- Learn algorithms and data structures used in distributed systems, my links will be below
- If you're a full time software engineer then you have to ask for a challenging problem to your manager, I'm really blessed to
have an awesome manager that really cared about me in my previous company and actually helped me create projects from scratch, 
that was one of the reasons why I stayed there for so long.

### Interview preparation

- Master the structure of the interview, [I followed this system design template](https://leetcode.com/discuss/career/229177/My-System-Design-Template)
  - Spend some time asking the right questions, don't make too many assumptions and if you do say them out loud so your interviewer is aware of this
  - Define functional and non-functional requirements, decide what are you going to optimize for e.g. high availability or consistency 
  - Do some back of the envelope calculations if needed, always clarify with your interviewer, this step is crucial at big
    companies where you need to design for scale and think about capacity planning
  - Define the API (signature, inputs, outputs)
  - High level design, make sure that your design covers all the use functional requirements, don't go too deep here or you'll waste invaluable time
  - Pick a component (or alternatively the interviewer may pick it for you) and then explain why you need it, big focus here on tradeoffs
  - Since this is a design for scale you'll need to split processing or data into multiple machines, learn how to handle failures at scale
  - If you have time talk about security and monitoring, things that you'd do to maintain the system   
- Learn how to use google drawings, [this is my google drawings template](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/11GQ_JBU5AH9BV40BulAuFIv66CexIad1zalG26OzZh4/edit?usp=sharing) and
 [this is an example of how I used it](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1PbxOaBTwC3BfTMpZx9WtRmoSnWfMM5cmCSAT5mrqODA/edit?usp=sharing)
- Big focus on mentioning tradeoffs, for example, let's say that you want to have a chat app that needs to send and
receive messages in real time

{{< interview-example >}}
For this problem I think that there are multiple ways to solve it:

- **polling**, here the client will periodically make requests at some fixed rate like every 30s, the disadvantage
is that every time we're creating a new connection and wasting server resources because we might not have
any message to send or receive
- **long polling**, in this approach similar to polling we instead keep the connection opened and wait for the 
server to send some data across the wire, as soon as we receive data we reopen/create a connection
- **web sockets**, in this approach we keep the connection open since ws connections are persistent and is made
for bidirectional communication, for the application protocol we can use the XMPP protocol. 
{{< /interview-example >}}

- Know the numbers, in an interview you might be given some numbers to work with or you might need to make them on your
own based on your experience, you get better at estimating things with practice, [I have created an article
with exercises and estimates that could be helpful](/notes/computer-science/system-design/back-of-the-envelope-calculations/),
 I've taken this example from [Gaurav Sen's awesome course on system design](https://get.interviewready.io/)

{{< interview-example >}}
> We're going to design an email server for 2B users, when a user sends an email it can attach files with a size up to 1MB,
> How much storage do we need per day to store emails? 

Let's say each email has 200 characters, on average. A user receives emails from useful connections, companies and spam.
Assume 20 spam emails, 20 marketing emails and 10 useful emails, per user per day.

```
Email data = Emails * Characters * Users 
           = 50 * 200 * 2B 
           = 20 TB

Attachment data = number of emails with attachments * average attachment size
                = 5% of all emails * 1 MB
                = 5% * 50 * 2B * 1 MB = 5 PB
```

So the total space requirement is `Email data + Attachment data = 20TB + 5 PB` per day. 
This is a naively optimistic estimate, since we must account for redundancy (to improve performance and fault tolerance).
`Estimated total space requirement = (20TB + 5 PB) * 3 ~ â€‹15PB per day`.

## Behavioral Questions

Google and Facebook have 1 behavioral round, Airbnb has 2 behavioral rounds, for this part Cracking the Coding interview helped a lot.

- the level inside the company is based on your answers of this round, talk about your leadership skills!
- learn to introduce yourself, you might do this in some coding rounds too, definitely a must for the team matching phase at Google or Airbnb, the template
that I use is:

> Hello, my name is `{your name}` and I'm a software engineer at `{current company}` where we do `{description of the product}`, 
> I'm currently working on `{project A doing frontend, backend, infra, ml, etc}`. In the past I worked at `{past company}` where I did `{more projects}`.
> On the side I'm doing `{school coursework or extracurricular activities}` and my next objective is to achieve `{objective in the short term}`.

- learn about STAR, create a grid with questions, projects and answers for each one
- practice with a friend, I'm friends with an awesome googler that helped me a lot here with mock interviews, we practiced many times and he noticed that my 
answers were not specific enough or were not structured pretty well, to improve I wrote down my answers for all of these questions and rehearsed them many times:
  - Tell me about a challenging project
  - What did you enjoy learning the most?
  - Tell me about a time you had a conflict of priorities with your manager
  - Tell me about a time you made a mistake
  - Tell me about a time you had to make a difficult decision
  - Tell me how you solved an unambiguous task at work
  - What are the qualities of a good leader according to you?

{{< interview who="airbnb" >}}

A special note about Airbnb, they do care about the culture fit more than anyone, spend some time understanding what `belong anywhere` means, 
I watched a lot of interviews to Brian Chesky which helped me solidify my willing to work with Airbnb [(6 golden rules)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgPYSogOOTY), 
in the onsite you have 2 behavioral rounds with questions that can be found here: https://candor.co/interviews/airbnb, the most important ones are

- **What does belonging mean to you? What is your understanding of Airbnb culture?**
- **Why Airbnb?**

Make sure you practice some of these even before you apply to Airbnb, the recruiter wants to know if you're really interested in Airbnb
{{< /interview >}}

{{< interview who="facebook" >}}
They have a behavioral round of 30m with questions and an easy coding question at the end.

{{< interview who="google" >}}
Pure behavioral round, if you're targeting L5+ show that you're a leader!
